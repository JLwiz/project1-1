            For this project I attempted to create a nicer website for my dad‘s business than what they are currently using. Their website is very outdated and I was hoping that I could use the skills that I’ve learned so far in this class to make a modest website that they may be able to use at the end of the semester. 
            I ran into situations where I had to use third party content. I have favicons on all the pages and it is a small image of a washer. There is also a picture of laundry equipment on the main homepage. There were also situations where pictures of people were needed. In those situations, I used a fake person generator which creates images of people that do not exist.
            In all cases I made sure I was able to use the content on my website. You may see various citations around the website containing links to the original image or its license.
            <br><br>Our first page is the homepage which gives you a little bit of detail about the business. It has a animation that brings in the a “request service” button which will then take you to the contact page. That page has a form that doesn’t have functionality yet but later projects will take the input that the user enters. We also have a reviews page which is kind of like a proof of concept showing some random made up people and some possible things they might say about the company. This would obviously be changed to real information if the website was ever used but I unfortunately do not have access to real data for now. We also have an “our work” page and that page basically just shows you what kind of services you would choose to be a client. 
            Lastly, we have the about page which shows you some information about a few of the employees.
            <br><br>The site has a header that uses a remote font from Google Fonts.
            We have a navigation bar that is constant across all the different pages.
            <br>
            All the HTML files have been validated.
            I try to favor the left alignment most the time especially the text but for the headers and some other information it made sense to place it where it is.
            I included a link to the whirlpool website showing different examples of different washers and dryer‘s. I also included a link to a Google maps directions page so they know how to get to the office.

            <br><br>I tried my best to make the website as comprehensive as possible but there were moments I was running into problems with lack of data to use. I tried to make use of most of the space
            and work with as much information I had about the business as possible. As far as the technical side of the site goes: This site is up to date with the github repository and should have no differences. The site is using
            a TLS 1.3 certificate from Let's Encrypt. Attempting to connect using HTTP will redirect you to the HTTPS version of the site. This is very important for the future so when users enter input, it doesn't get seen by anyone
            else on the wire. It also protects the integrity of the site and making sure they are seeing the correct version that I intended them to see without any modifications.
